# ConanInventoryAutoSort
A place to combine issues and releases for a mod to Conan Exiles that auto-sorts inventory

# What to do
For releases, see the folders on this page.
**BETA RELEASES ARE NOT STABLE!**

If you have any problems, please see the [issues page](../../issues).
When adding an issue, please include **screenshots** as well as steps to reproduce the problem, otherwise I cannot help you (and will probably close the issue)!
There is also a discussion page for feature requests, and other ideas.

As most of us know, life is busy, so there is no express guarantee I will get to any issue on a given timeline.

# Contributing
Due to community concerns about stolen work, the source code is hosted in a private repo.
Please reach out if you are interested in helping, and I can grant you access!
